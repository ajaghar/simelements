Welcome to the SimElements web site!

SimElements is a Python-based package for dynamic/continuous and discrete event simulation. It also has provisions for uncertainty analysis and optimization.

SimElements is entirely based on Python and requires Python 3.0 or later versions. Nothing else is needed in order for it to work: no NumPy, no SimPy, no *Py, no nothing, except Python 3.x. No recompilation or relinking of your present implementation of Python is needed: you may place SimElements in any directory on your computer and use it immediately.

Python programming is needed to set up a simulation using SimElements. SimElements provides a number of classes, modules and functions for solving problems with as little programming effort as possible. Normally, no additional definition of classes will be necessary, so setting up a simulation can be carried out with procedural type programming (although you will have to punch out objects using classes provided by SimElements). SimElements offers statistical output processing, but does not have a graphical user interface, and no graphical output features. Spreadsheet (tab-delimited) format output is supported, though. SimElements comes with an extensive docstring documentation.

SimElements is offered free of charge under a GNU General Public License.

Here are a couple of Python source code demos of how to use SimElements (will open in new windows):
host_parasite.py
mm1queue.py
These examples provide the solutions to very basic, simple problems. SimElements has lots of capabilities for solving much more complex problems.
